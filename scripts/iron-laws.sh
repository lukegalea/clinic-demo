#
# Judge this repository's Elixir code against the 26 Iron Laws, using the
# deterministic judge in ash_agent_tools (`mix ash_agent.laws`). Wired into
# `mix precommit` and CI; the reasoning, the reviewed baseline and the
# standing dispositions are in docs/IRON-LAWS.md and usage-rules.md.
#
# Usage: scripts/iron-laws.sh [all|diff|tree]
#
#   diff  Judge only the lines added since BASE: committed-but-unpushed work,
#         staged and unstaged edits, and untracked files. BASE is the merge
#         base of HEAD with $IRON_LAWS_BASE (CI sets it) or, by default, with
#         origin/main. An empty diff passes.
#   tree  Judge every tracked Elixir file and compare the hits with the
#         reviewed baseline, scripts/iron-laws.baseline.json. A hit missing
#         from the baseline fails; so does a baseline entry that no longer
#         fires, so the baseline cannot silently outlive the code it excuses.
#   all   Both (the default).
#
# Both modes gate at the judge's default floor, `likely`, and in both a hit
# that matches a baseline entry (same law, file and trimmed line) passes.
# Review-tier hits are counted in the JSON but never fail the run.
#
# ash_agent_tools is an `only: :dev` dependency, so the judge always runs under
# MIX_ENV=dev -- including when this script is called from `mix precommit`,
# which itself runs under MIX_ENV=test. The judge is pure text processing: it
# neither boots nor compiles the application.
