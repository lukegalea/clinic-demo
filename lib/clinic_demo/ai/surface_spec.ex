defmodule ClinicDemo.AI.SurfaceSpec do
  @moduledoc """
  What the model composed for an ad-hoc table request.

  A plain typed struct with no behaviour, mirroring `ClinicDemo.AI.Intent`.
  The composed surface spec is genuinely free-form -- its vocabulary is the
  `ash_a2ui` dynamic allowlist, not a fixed set of keys -- so it arrives as
  JSON **text** in `spec` rather than as nested maps. That is not a dodge:
  OpenAI's Responses API rejects any structured-output schema containing an
  open object (every object must carry `additionalProperties: false`), so a
  `:map` return cannot be given a valid schema at all. A closed
  string-carrying struct can, and the server still validates the decoded JSON
  against the same allowlist the prompt was generated from before anything is
  rendered.

  The struct also **is** the schema: `ash_ai` derives the JSON schema the
  model is constrained to from these field definitions, so there is no
  separate schema to drift.
