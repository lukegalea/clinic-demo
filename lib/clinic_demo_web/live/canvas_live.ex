defmodule ClinicDemoWeb.CanvasLive do
  @moduledoc """
  The dev-only `/canvas` surface: the application's domains, resources and
  relationships as a navigable object graph, with a server-resolved
  naked-object inspector on selection.

  The graph itself is rendered by the `<ash-canvas-graph>` Lit element
  (driver lane, Cytoscape under the hood) through the `AshCanvas` hook. This
  LiveView owns the two server sides of that contract:

    * on connected mount it builds the graph with
      `AshA2ui.Canvas.build_graph/1` over `ClinicDemo.Canvas.Registry`
      and pushes it once as `"canvas:graph"` — structural nodes only. No
      record is ever a node, and no read happens at all: the graph is
      declared metadata, not a query (`A2UI-103/AC-4`).
    * `handle_event("canvas:select", …)` is the *only* client event that
      exists. It resolves one opaque ref through
      `AshA2ui.Canvas.resolve/2` under the signed-in actor and
      re-renders the inspector. There is no event that can request records:
      a record enters the picture only when someone resolves a record ref,
      which is an authorized read, and a ref the actor cannot read is the
      same fail-closed `{:error, :unknown_object}` as garbage.

  The inspector is server-rendered HEEx — deliberately not an A2UI surface —
  because its job is to *show what the library knows* (provenance,
  capabilities, projections) rather than to be one of the projections it
  describes. Where a resource has a declared app surface, the browse
  projection becomes a link to it via `ClinicDemoWeb.A2ui.Surfaces`.

        The height is load-bearing, not styling. `<ash-canvas-graph>` is
        `height: 100%` against this element, and its two panes are a CSS grid
        -- so with no definite height here, the grid's row is sized by its
        tallest content, which is the outline list. At 68 resources that list
        is around 1900px, the canvas frame becomes 1900px with it, and
        Cytoscape dutifully fits the graph into that box and centres it: the
        graph ends up ~950px down, below the fold, drawn small enough to read
        as an empty canvas. Every check short of looking at the pixels passes,
        because the data, the nodes and the fit are all correct.

        Bounding the height puts the outline back on its own scrollbar
        (`.cv-tree-scroll` is already `overflow-y: auto; min-height: 0`,
        built for exactly this) and gives the graph the viewport.

        The container is rendered ALWAYS and hidden with a class, never
        removed. `Host.present/3` delivers the surface by pushing an event to
        the `AshA2ui` hook, and a hook that does not exist yet receives
        nothing -- so rendering this conditionally means the first selection
        pushes into a void and the panel stays blank. Same reason AgentLive
        keeps its container mounted.
