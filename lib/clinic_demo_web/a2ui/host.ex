defmodule ClinicDemoWeb.A2ui.Host do
  @moduledoc """
  Hosts an A2UI surface inside a LiveView that is not otherwise an A2UI
  LiveView.

  `AshA2ui.LiveRenderer` is the batteries-included transport and is what
  `ClinicDemoWeb.A2ui.*Live` use: one surface, chosen at compile time, for the
  whole module. `ClinicDemoWeb.AgentLive` cannot use it, for two reasons that
  are both structural rather than stylistic:

    * it does not know which surface it will show until somebody asks, and
    * the surface it shows may be one the helper agent *composed*, which is an
      `%AshA2ui.Dynamic.Surface{}` rather than a UI module — a shape
      `LiveRenderer` has no way to take.

  So this is the small amount of `LiveRenderer` that AgentLive needs, written
  over both shapes. It deliberately does **not** reach for `LiveRenderer`'s
  `surface_fn`/`data_model_fn` options, which are documented there as test seams
  that applications must not rely on.

  ## What a presentation is

  A `%Presentation{}` names one surface and everything needed to keep it live:
  which topics to listen on, and the last `/query` state the client was sent so
  a background refresh re-runs the viewer's current search and page rather than
  resetting them.

  Surface *contexts* are not tracked. No surface in this application declares
  one, and carrying state for a feature nothing uses would be untested code that
  looks load-bearing. `AshA2ui.LiveRenderer` does track them, and is the thing to
  copy from if a context surface ever needs hosting here.
